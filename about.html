                    I am a UI/UX Professional working on medical alerting devices in EHRs at the Information Science for Healthcare lab at Drexel University.

                <p class="about-info2">
                    I am working in partnership with Children’s National Hospital and Rutgers University. The overall goal of our project is to develop a computer-aided approach for detecting PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) nonadherence in a group medical setting.
I received a BFA in Communication Arts from Virginia Commonwealth University. I graduated during the height of the pandemic, but was able to find employment doing data visualization, graphic design, and illustration. Over time I learned about ui/ux, and started taking online classes through the Interactive Design Foundation. I fell in love with ui/ux, and enrolled at Drexel for their HCI/UX master’s program.

                <p class="about-info3">I have always loved art, so much so that I got an undergraduate degree in Visual Communications. I enjoy drawing, painting, and learning about different historical art movments. I mainly make art digitally now, but bring out physical mediums every once and a while.

                    While I have much less time now to indulge, games were and still occasionally are one of the great ways i stay in touch with friends who live far away. I am somewhat competative and enjoy the opportunity to strategize especially with friends.

                    While i have always loved reading, after graduating from college I found i had more time to choose the type of book I read. I especially love books that cover philosophical and historical topics. I'm usually in one to two books clubs depending on how much time i have.
