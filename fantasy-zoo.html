    <h1>Biome Zoo</h1>
<h3>Website’s purpose and functionality:</h3>
<p>
    Our product is a website that both acts as a promotional tool, and as a portal through which users can purchase tickets and goods. Our website advertises our concept, a “biome zoo.” A Biome Zoo is like a typical zoo except instead of visitors going from one area to another viewing animals decontextualized, we help our visitors understand the animals in context. We recreate each biome so that visitors can experience the flora and fauna in person. Animals either cohabitate, or are separated for their safety, but the moment a visitor steps into one of our biomes they will be transported.
</p>
<p>
    The website also serves as a digital gateway to the diverse ecosystems of our planet. The primary purpose is to provide the visitor with an exciting and engaging overview of our Biome Zoo, its inhabitants and the unique experience it offers. 
</p>
<p>
    The website is organized and made up around the four biomes represented in the zoo, which is the Tropical Dry Forest, the Tundra, the Jungle, and the Savannah.  Each biome section provided detailed information about the animals that inhabit it and engaging facts about those animals along with its conservative statues. 
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the website also features an events page and an activities pages. These pages keep visitors updated on incoming events as well as what activities are currently offered in the Zoo. Difference from the events, activities offer more interactive experiences and attractions that visitors can enjoy directly at the zoo.  
    Furthermore, the website also offers a look of what is in the gift shop in our zoo. Users can purchase the gift in the shop or straight online. 
Last but not least, the website offers the most important function, that allows visitors to buy tickets online in order to save the visitors time and effort. 
</p>

<p>
    The website is designed to be user friendly and accessible with its intuitive navigation features. It works as an interactive tool that brings the zoo to the hand of the visitors, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of the world's diverse biome and the animals that live in them.

    Feedback: 
</h3>
<p>
    These are the 2 most important feedbacks from couples of feedbacks we received:
</p>
<p>“The website does an excellent job in providing detailed information about the biomes as well as the animal that inhabits it, it is also easy to navigate as well as understand what is going on. However, it seems the website lacks information about the biomes, I would love to see more pictures of the biomes as well as animal” - Mark .C </p>
<h3>
    Reflection:
</h3>
<p>
    Our team realized that even though this is a prototyping project, aesthetic and appeal from pictures of the zoo is really attractive. However, without actually having a real zoo, there is no way we can have a realistic picture of the zoo as well as the biomes. Furthermore, we also use more pictures, facts, and less words to keep the website interactive. Finally, the whole website was there to help visitors understand a bit more about the zoo as well as pique their interest and help them decide if they should buy a ticket or not. 
</p>

    Feedback: 
</h3>
<p>
    “The website is really cool, though the main purpose I visit the website is to know more about the zoo and to see if it's worth going, and in order to go there, I would have to buy a ticket. It would be nice if I can access the ticket buying pages every time I need.” -Yash .J
</p>
<h3>
    Reflection:
</h3>
<p>
    This feedback really helps us in focusing on what is the most important function of the website, so in order to deliver these functions. We prototyped the main menu bar, which includes all the unique and important functions, to always be at the top of the website no matter what page the user and visitor are looking at. 
</p>
<h2>
    Comprehensive design justification and analysis:
</h2>
<h3>
    Reflection 
</h3>
<p>
    As the developers of the Biome Zoo website, we decided to focus on a few key principles such as: user-friendliness, education and information value, engaging and attractive. The website is also designed with the end-user in mind, as to be aware of what the visitor wants to see, want to know, and what the visitor will most likely to ignore based on the feedback provided. 
</p>
<p>
    Information wise, the website is designed to be engaging and educate visitors about the different biomes and animals in it as much as possible, but not too overwhelming. This allows the website to touch a tiny bit of users' curiosity.
</p>
<p>
    One of the website limitations is mobile optimization. Our group decided to move against the mobile app product due to not many people using phones to look for information about the zoo at the zoo. Furthermore, if users want to buy tickets and know more about the zoo, it is best that it was optimized for
</p>
<p>
    We started by sketching, and building out how many, and of what type of functionality we would need. Our process was much more based around the logistics, and information organization, than maybe a typical design background. For both of us (Hai and Jonah) our background in information planning and organization comes from a software engineering background. We focused on a parent child organizational structure. We did not create a page for each animal in each biome as we did not have time, but did make one animal page per biome as a proof of concept. With additional time we would have liked to expand into the flora of each biome, as they are also an invaluable part of our experience.
</p>
<p>
    We wanted the site to function smoothly, and made sure that there were multiple paths through which one could get to their designation when applicable. For example there are three ways one could navigate to the Jungle biome. 1. Through the photo on the home page. 2. Through the menu item on the navigation bar. 3. By clicking on it on the map.
</p>

<h3>Interactive animations</h3>
<p>
    After building our structure we began testing a number of interactive systems. We both were excited to implement interactive features within figma, but sadly had to throw out a lot of work once we found that it simply got in the way. This has been an invaluable experience for us, as we went from trying to animate almost everything, to animating almost nothing. Of particular consternation, was our homepage. We probably created and threw out 3 fully working homepages with different layouts and interactions.
</p>

<h3>
    Graphic Design
</h3>
<p>
    We aimed to ride the fine line where our website could be both professional, and fun/child friendly. We used large photographs of animals, contrasted by dark blue menus, with bright open white space. We added color accents (especially an off red) to help highlight certain elements. However our most difficult task was conveying the biome zoo concept. Ultimately we used a hybrid of ai-generation and photobashing to get a rough approximation viewable on the front page. The map was built with large black lines and solid colors to create a caricature of each biome.
